# wearables-scanner

A simple scene that shows how to fetch player wearable data to match against a criteria. In this case, only players wearing eyewear are allowed in.

The crypto Utils function makes it a lot simpler to perform blockchain functions. Sending MANA from one account to another just takes one line of code using this library.
